# covid-19 detection from chest x-ray images using convolution neural networks



The goals of this project are threefold: 
- [1]               To explore development of a machine learning algorithm to distinguish chest X-rays of individuals with respiratory illness testing positive for COVID-19 from other X-rays,
- [2]               To promote discovery of patterns in such X-rays via CNN interpretability algorithms, and
- [3]               To build more robust and extensible machine learning infrastructure trained on a variety of data types, to aid in the global response to COVID-19.
- [4]               To achive best Accuracy.


## install:
* ### Python 3.6
    * recommend installing Anaconda as it is already set up for machine learning
    * Or else use Google's Colab with all libraries installed
* ### Libraries Required
    *  Kearas 
        * Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks,   
    *  TensorFlow
        * TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. TensorFlow bundles together a slew of machine learning and deep learning (aka neural networking) models 
    *  Mathplotlib
        * Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
    *  pandas
        * pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
    *  sklearn.metrics
        * The sklearn. metrics module implements several loss, score, and utility functions to measure classification performance
    *  seaborn
       * To visualize confusion matrix
