# covid-19 detection from chest x-ray images using convolution neural networks



The goals of this project are threefold: 
- [1]               To explore development of a machine learning algorithm to distinguish chest X-rays of individuals with respiratory illness testing positive for COVID-19 from other X-rays,
- [2]               To promote discovery of patterns in such X-rays via CNN interpretability algorithms, and
- [3]               To build more robust and extensible machine learning infrastructure trained on a variety of data types, to aid in the global response to COVID-19.
